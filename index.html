                  The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, or just
                  <i>ENIAC</i>, was the first programable general-purpose
                  electronic computer. The <i>ENIAC</i> started construction in
                  1943 during World War II by Americans at the Moore School of
                  Electronic Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. Its
                  main developers were physicist John Mauchly and engineer J.
                  Presper Eckert, Jr. With funding from the government, the
                  <i>ENIAC</i> was contracted by the military to compute
                  artillery range tables to assist the allies in the war. The
                  <i>ENIAC</i> was completed in 1946 with an expense of
                  $400,000. Although the war was over, the
                  <i>ENIAC</i> performed calculations for the creation of a
                  hydrogen bomb.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The <i>ENIAC</i> could compute at electronic speeds, but
                  several inefficiencies caused the programmability to be poor.
                  This novel computing speed required never seen power to be
                  required which made the <i>ENIAC</i> the most powerful
                  calculating machine built at that point. Because of its
                  conditional branching, the <i>ENIAC</i> could be programmed
                  for an array of tasks and problems giving the
                  <i>ENIAC</i> considerable flexibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The <i>ENIAC</i> was mammoth in size. The
                  <i>ENIAC</i> occupied the entire 50-by-30-foot basement of the
                  Moore School. It had 40 panels that lined three walls of the
                  basement in a U-shape. The 17,000 vacuum tubes, 70,000
                  resistors, 10,000 capacitors, 6,000 switches, and 1,500 relays
                  made the <i>ENIAC</i> as well as powerful also the most
                  complex electronic device built to date. The
                  <i>ENIAC</i> needed its own air conditioning system to chill
                  the 174 kilowatts of heat generated. The <i>ENIAC</i> could
                  compute 5,000 additions per second making the
                  <i>ENIAC</i> several orders of magnitude faster than its
                  predecessors.

                  The IBM 5150, or the <i>IBM Personal Computer</i>, was
                  introduced in August 1981. Though personal computers were
                  numerous a decade before, none were as feature-rich and as
                  popular as the <i>IBM Personal Computer</i>. The
                  <i>IBM Personal Computer</i> made it attractive to a variety
                  of consumers. The IBM Personal Computer was fully led by Don
                  Estridge and was completed in less than a year. The
                  development team used various tactics to enable them to
                  announce the IBM Personal Computer in 12 months, the fastest
                  IBM ever did at that time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The <i>IBM Personal Computer</i> had a price of $1,565. This
                  price tag was more than one order of magnitude cheaper than
                  its predecessor two decades prior. An IBM computer costed 9
                  million dollars, required a quarter-acre of space to
                  air-condition, and 60 people to maintain it. And yet, the IBM
                  Personal Computer had faster processing, hooked up to a TV,
                  played games, and harbored more words than a fat cookbook.
                  There were other options a consumer could buy for their
                  specific needs like a printer, display, or extra memory.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The <i>IBM Personal Computer</i> was powered by an Intel 8088
                  microprocessor operating at speeds measured in the millionths
                  of a second and was the size of a portable typewriter. It
                  contained 40K of read-only memory, 16K of user memory, and a
                  built-in speaker for music. The
                  <i>IBM Personal Computer</i> became an instant success after
                  its first announcement. By the end of 1982, IBM’s sales for
                  the <i>IBM Personal Computer</i> were at a rate of a
                  system-a-minute for every business day. The
                  <i>IBM Personal Computer</i> set the standard of what a
                  computer should be.

                <p>
                  Apple introduced the <i>Macintosh</i> on January 24, 1984. The
                  <i>Macintosh</i> was revolutionary for it being the first
                  personal computer to popularize the mouse and the graphical
                  user interface instead of its command-line predecessors.
                  Originally priced at around $2,500, the <i>Macintosh</i> used
                  icons to run programs instead of typing out commands by using
                  a graphical user interface or GUI. Clicking and dragging was
                  also a feature unique to the <i>Macintosh</i> with the use of
                  a mouse. The <i>Macintosh</i> was designed to have an
                  intuitive user-friendly interface. Jef Raskin envisioned the
                  idea of the <i>Macintosh</i> in the late 1970s and assembled a
                  development team beginning in 1979 but development fell into
                  the hands of Steve Jobs in 1981.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The <i>Macintosh</i> was not popular right away. Users found
                  that the original 128K of RAM was not enough. They soon
                  released a version with four times as much memory nicknamed
                  “Fat Mac.” It contained a Motorola 68000 microprocessor
                  running at 8 MHz, 512KB of RAM, 64 KB of ROM, and a 400 KB
                  floppy disk drive. Applications included on the
                  <i>Macintosh</i> were a word processor called MacWrite and a
                  drawing program called MacPaint. Apple also introduced the
                  LaserWriter printer for the <i>Macintosh</i>
                  which enabled printing for users. Apple discontinued the
                  <i>Macintosh</i> in April 1986 after selling hundreds of
                  thousands of them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Apple’s <i>Macintosh</i> paved the way for the utilization of
                  a GUI and a mouse. Computers today would be almost unusable
                  without these significant elements present. Apple turned these
                  unpopular features into a modern-day necessity. Though the
                  <i>Macintosh</i> did not have a great start, it still sold
                  hundreds of thousands of units because of its incredible user
                  experience.

                  <i>Windows</i> was announced on November 10, 1983, by at the
                  time a small company called Microsoft. Microsoft was founded
                  by Bill Gates and Paul Allen. Since 1981, Microsoft has been
                  the primary partner of IBM. The IBM Personal Computer’s
                  operating system was MS-DOS which was made by Microsoft.
                  MS-DOS became a popular operating system, but it had a
                  command-line interface. Bill Gates started to develop
                  <i>Windows</i> because he realized the profitability from a
                  successful graphical interface for IBM computers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Two years later, <i>Windows</i> was introduced on November 20,
                  1985, and sold for $100. <i>Windows</i> version 1.0 did not
                  have a great start as it was considered buggy, crude, and
                  slow. Apple also threatened a lawsuit against Microsoft for
                  infringement of copyright and patents. Microsoft’s
                  <i>Windows</i> was very similar to Apple’s operating system
                  called Software System. They both had similar dropdown menus,
                  tiled windows, and mouse support, but Gates offered to license
                  Software System’s features and a contract was agreed upon.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <i>Windows</i> was one of the first graphical user interfaces.
                  It was different from Apple’s Software System because it was
                  not only exclusive to Apple computers. This meant that IBM
                  computers could finally have access to features from Macintosh
                  like mouse support. Even though Software System was far
                  superior to the first iteration of <i>Windows</i>, development
                  considerably improved the <i>Windows</i> graphical user
                  interface to that of Software System. Today, <i>Windows</i> is
                  the most popular operating system in the world and Microsoft
                  is one of the most successful companies in the world.

                  The <i>World Wide Web</i> was created by Tim Berners-Lee in
                  1989. He worked as a computer scientist for CERN. The original
                  plan for the <i>World Wide Web</i> was to automate information
                  sharing between scientists in universities around the world.
                  This was specifically helpful for scientists at CERN because
                  most of them live around the world at universities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee wrote the first proposal for the
                  <i>World Wide Web</i> called “Information Management: A
                  Proposal.” In almost a year after his first proposal, the
                  first website was online at CERN. Info.cern.ch and
                  http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html were the
                  first websites that were created. These websites were basic
                  and contained information about Tim Berners-Lee's project. Few
                  people had access to the <i>World Wide Web</i>, so development
                  switched to a line-mode browser to make it more accessible. In
                  December 1991, the <i>World Wide Web</i> made its way into the
                  United States and the first website was online at the Stanford
                  Linear Accelerator Center in California. Many developers who
                  worked on the <i>World Wide Web</i> were from institutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But in early 1993, CERN made the source code of the World Wide
                  Web royalty-free. This led to the start of hundreds of
                  websites being created at the end of 1993. More popularity and
                  growth occurred the following year. At the end of 1994, the
                  <i>World Wide Web</i> had a staggering 10,000 servers and 10
                  million users. Though it was still lacking many of today’s
                  features, the <i>World Wide Web</i> rapidly became what it is
                  today.
